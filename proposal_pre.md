## Abstract

- **Combining Battlesnake with deep reinforcement learning**
- **Developing purely policy-based agent**
- **Adapting to resource-constrained environments**
- **Benchmarking against tree-search-based agents**

<!-- slide -->
## Project Rationale

- **Battlesnake: online programming competition**
- **Traditional approaches: heuristics, tree search**
- **Challenges: large search space, time constraints**
- **Motivation: apply deep reinforcement learning**

<!-- slide -->
## Research Content and Objectives

- **Develop purely deep-reinforcement-learning-based agent**
- **Balance between inference time and model capability**

<!-- slide -->
## Research Plan and Feasibility Analysis

- **Develop agent based on open-source implementations**
- **Feature extraction and reward design**
- **Training using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
- **Benchmarking against "ich heisse marvin"**
- **Deployment on standard Duke VM for real-world evaluation**
